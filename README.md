# RAG-based Q&A Chatbot
## Overview
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chat assistant designed to help users interactively query PDF documents using natural language. By combining Google's Gemini API for generation with document retrieval techniques, the chatbot is capable of answering user questions with contextually accurate information extracted from uploaded PDFs.

The tool is aimed at building a chat assistant that demonstrates the power of combining document parsing, semantic search, and large language models to enable smart, personalized, and accurate document-based question-answering.

## Description
The chatbot allows users to upload a PDF and ask any question related to its content. It follows a modular pipeline and follows a workflow as depicted in the flow chart below.
