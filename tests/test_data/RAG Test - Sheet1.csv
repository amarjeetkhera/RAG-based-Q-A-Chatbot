What happens to maize at temperatures between 35°C and 40°C?,"Temperatures between 35°C and 40°C may cause heat stress and eventually plant damage, especially during the reproductive phase."
What is the minimum temperature for maize germination?,The minimum temperature for maize germination is 10°C and ideally above 15°C.
What is the range of annual rainfall requirements for maize?,"Annual rainfall requirements for maize may vary from 500 mm up to 2,000 mm depending on cultivar and environment."
What was the global maize area for dry grain in 2020?,The global maize area for dry grain in 2020 amounted to 202 million hectares.
Which continent accounted for the largest share of harvested maize area in 2020?,"In 2020, the Americas accounted for around 36% of harvested maize area."
What share of maize production is used as feed at the global level?,"At the global level, maize is primarily used as feed, accounting for 59% of total production."
What percentage of total maize production is used for food globally?,"At the global level, 13% of total maize production is used for food."
In which regions is maize an important human food crop?,"Maize is an important human food crop in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and a few countries in Asia."
What family and genus does maize belong to?,Maize belongs to the family Poaceae and the genus Zea.
What was the total global maize production in 2020 according to FAOSTAT?,"The total global maize production in 2020 was 1,162 million tons."
What percentage of the total area under cereal production in Africa is maize?,"In Africa, 30% of the total area under cereal production is maize."
What proportion of maize production in the developing world comes from low and lower middle-income countries?,67% of maize production in the developing world comes from low and lower middle-income countries.
"According to global results, what percentage of rain-fed cropland was assessed as potentially suitable for maize production?",About 55% of the rain-fed cropland was assessed as potentially suitable for rain-fed maize production.
What percentage of land equipped for irrigation was suitable for maize production?,About 80% of current land equipped for irrigation was assessed as suitable for maize production.
How is the suitability of a crop determined in the GAEZ methodology?,"Suitability is determined by comparing crop requirements with agro-climatic and agro-edaphic conditions, adjusting yields according to soil limitations and terrain constraints."
What trend in maize suitability is projected for higher latitudes and altitudes under climate change by the 2050s?,The extent of land suitable for maize increases with warming at higher latitudes and altitudes by the 2050s.
What happens to maize suitability trends in most regions by the 2080s under progressive climate change?,"In most regions, suitable area in the 2080s is less compared to the 2050s."
Which groups of farmers are most vulnerable to climate change impacts on maize productivity?,Smallholder farmers in developing countries are most vulnerable as they depend entirely on rain-fed agriculture.
What does the term ‘potential attainable yield’ mean in the GAEZ context?,"Potential attainable yield refers to crop-wise information about potential production and crop cycle attributes under given soil, terrain, and climate conditions."
What constraint factors are considered in GAEZ yield reduction assessments?,"Constraint factors include temperature, moisture, agro-climatic constraints, soil limitations, and terrain-slope conditions."
What does GAEZ use to calculate soil moisture deficits and irrigation requirements?,GAEZ applies a daily soil water balance calculation to determine soil moisture deficits and irrigation requirements.
What was the historical average global net irrigation water requirement for maize (1981–2010)?,The historical average global net irrigation water requirement for maize was 431 mm.
Which regions achieved the highest yield achievement ratios for maize in the recent past?,"The highest yield achievement ratios for maize were obtained in Europe, North America, and Brazil."
